                            <p class="lead" id="less-content">Back in 2015, Marvel Studios released two of its Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbusters during that summer, continuing the massive superhero extravaganza with Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man. While the superhero team adventure
                                in Age of Ultron continued to progress the overall arc MCU story forward (further expanding on certain ideas and character motives), Ant-Man, which was director Peyton Reed, was a more smaller scale endeavor, but still
                                produce a unique feature film. In a nutshell, the movie, which starred Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Pena, and others, told the story of Scott Lang, a now freed convicted felon, of how he must defend
                                Hank Pym’s Ant-Man shrinking technology and gets entangled in a plot heist against Pym’s villainous protegee Darren Cross. As being a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (the sixteenth film), the film, which did face
                                a bit of a rocky road to get to production (i.e. the switching of directors from Edgar Wright to Peyton Reed), faced some criticism, but was (in general terms) received positively by moviegoers and critics, especially from
                                the film’s cast, it’s humorous bits, and its creative CGI sequences in its smaller scaled adventure. Additionally, Ant-Man went on to garnish roughly $519 million at the box office and closed out Marvel Phase II saga. Now,
                                three years later and after the massive success of Marvel’s other two 2018 releases (i.e. Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War), Marvel Studios and director Peyton Reed present the follow-up adventure to 2015’s Ant-Man
                                with the film Ant-Man and the Wasp. Does this latest superhero sequel have the right nuances to warrant a glance or is it frivolous entry in the MCU?
                                <br> Following the events after Captain America: Civil War, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is almost finished with his two years of house arrest that was part of his pardon deal after violating the Sokovia Accords by helping Steve
                                Rogers. With days before his house arrest is up, Scott looks forward to his “clean slate” life, spending time with his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) as well as his new security business with former cellmate pal Luis
                                (Michael Pena). However, Scott reconnects with his former associates Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), both of whom have been evading the FBI and run for the past two years.
                                During that time, they’ve assembled a lab where they’ve been building a gateway to the Quantum Realm in an attempt to rescue Hank’s wife and Hope’s mother, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), who went missing into the Quantum
                                Realm 30 years ago. Now, after Scott returned from the Quantum Realm in their previous adventure, Pym believes that Janet can be saved as well. However, while Hank and Hope work is coveted not only by criminal Sonny Burch
                                (Walton Goggins), but by the mysterious entity known as Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who can phase shift in and out of matter in an unstable manner. Additionally, while the group seeks aid from Pym’s old colleague Bill Foster
                                (Laurence Fishburne), FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) is in hot pursuit of Scott’s whereabouts. As all these characters collide and try to evade each other, Hank and Hope desperately try to plan a rescue mission for
                                Janet, while Scott must decide whether to protect his reformed life or suit up again as Ant-Man.
                                <br> I do remember (back in 2015) seeing Ant-Man twice in theaters (once by myself and the other with a few of my friends). To me, it was good, but not as good as some of Marvel’s better superhero features within this cinematic
                                universe. I mean, the Phase II saga had plenty of great films, including the more grounded narrative of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the cosmic adventure in Guardians of the Galaxy, and the blockbuster team up in
                                Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ant-Man was set on a more smaller scale (no pun intended) and was more of a compacted adventure rather than the sprawling blockbuster flair of its predecessor. In truth, there’s no doubt that Ant-Man
                                is actually the most lighthearted film in the MCU, choosing a more personal journey rather than a large scale “save the world” entry. Still, there was something about Ant-Man that made it more on the other end of the MCU
                                spectrum….at least in my opinion. I’m not staying that I didn’t enjoy (I loved Rudd as Scott Land and Douglas was excellent as Pym) and the whole micro world was a fun visual, but it was just a bit of an adequate Marvel
                                adventure rather than a spectacular one. This, of course, brings me back to talking about Ant-Man and the Wasp, the sequel to 2015’s Ant-Man and the third MCU of 2018. Yes, I’ve stated before, I’m a huge fan of Marvel,
                                particularly the Marvel Cinematic Universe feature films. So, I was excited to see this movie. Well, to be honest, I wasn’t that super excited, especially after the other two well-received 2018 movies (Black Panther and
                                Infinity War). Still, Ant-Man and the Wasp intrigued me, especially as to wear it would fit in the “grand scheme” of things in this superhero universe. Plus, I do like the cast, which given how the film’s movie trailers
                                were presented, featured a lot of the recognizable faces from either the previous Ant-Man film or from other film projects. So, being the last MCU of 2018, I went to see this movie, hoping that my expectations were matched
                                with what I wanted to see versus what the movie actually was. What did I think of it? Well, it’s fairly good. While the movie does fail in “upping the ante” in this cinematic universe, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun standalone
                                superhero adventure. It’s not the best or brightest that the MCU has to offer, but it’s still a small and amusing feature (despite it being the weakest entry in the MCU Phase III saga).

                                For the past ten years the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been the biggest film franchise around. But after a decade of consistently shattering box office records and with a cast stuffed full of Hollywood A-Listers, the sprawling ‘Infinity Saga’ climaxed
                                up with Avengers: Endgame last week.
                                <br> Unsurprisingly, film twenty-two in the MCU has been hugely successful, with a gigantic $1.2 billion dollar debut weekend and thousands heading out to midnight screenings across the globe. But as the end of Phase three
                                (well, kind of, we still have Spider-Man: Far From Home left in this “phase”), there were some huge events that will mean big changes for the Marvel universe. Big spoilers ahead, so if you haven’t seen Endgame yet here’s
                                your chance to look away. Here’s what Avengers: Endgame could mean for the future of the MCU.
                                <br> Fans correctly predicted (but the expectation didn’t make it any less emotional), that Endgame saw Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) die a hero’s death after using the Infinity Stones. This most likely marks the end of
                                Downey Jr’s involvement in the MCU, having played the role of Iron Man since 2008. However this doesn’t mean we won’t see other characters from the Iron Man films return, with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) set to appear in
                                Spider-Man: Far From Home.
                                <br> <b>The Black Widow standalone film will probably be a prequel</b> Marvel have confirmed that there’s going to be a standalone Black Widow film, but given the shock death of Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson)
                                in Endgame, this one will most likely be a prequel. Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour have all signed on for this film, so we can expect to the film to explore some of Natasha Romanoff’s earlier life before
                                she joined The Avengers.

                                Vin Diesel fans who can’t wait for the next installment of the “Fast and Furious” macho soap opera series can get their fix at “Bloodshot,” a comic book adaptation that’s as big a stickler about “family” yet far less satisfying than even the worst films
                                of the "Fast" franchise. The family in question here is the wife of Ray Garrison (Diesel), who is put in danger by her spouse’s mercenary soldiering. Now, if you want to walk into director Dave Wilson’s sci-fi actioner
                                as blindly as I did, exit this review now. If you desire a hint of what you’re in for, let me leave you with a few phrases you would have encountered had you stuck around: “Universal Soldier,” “robotic cucarachas,” “needle
                                drop abuse of the Talking Heads” and “blatant rip-off.”
                                <br> Even though “Bloodshot” is an adaptation of a comic book (unread by me), screenwriters Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer take their cues and their plot details from a slew of far better movies in this genre. Films like
                                “Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” “Robocop” and “Total Recall” are thrown into a blender and the diluted, flavorless results leave you hankering for the original ingredients. The most noticeable influence is “Universal Soldier,”
                                a film that shares so many plot elements that “Bloodshot” can be classified as a blatant rip-off. That movie spawned three sequels; I can only hope “Bloodshot”’s bloodline ends here. Adding insult to injury, the screenwriters
                                do that self-defensive meta thing that drives me up the damn wall, where they have characters acknowledge “hey, we’re ripping this particular movie off” and “hee-hee-hee! Aren’t these genre tropes that we’re using really
                                dumb and tired?” There’s such insincerity and passive-aggressive cowardice in this approach; it either invites the audience to feel superior to the material or worse, it acknowledges that the filmmakers know they are peddling
                                an inferior product to the consumer and they think you’re a sucker for buying it. I have more respect for a movie that damns the torpedoes, fully commits to its madness, and goes down in flames than one that intentionally
                                sets itself on fire as a precautionary measure. Case in point, and here there be spoilers: “Bloodshot” begins with Garrison returning home after a successful mission. He spends a romantic night with his wife, Gina (Tallulah
                                Riley) before being ambushed by henchmen employed by Martin Axe (Toby Kebbell). Axe is a wacky piece of work with a sadistic streak—in other words, your typical action movie villain. Taunting a tied-up Garrison, he puts
                                on a goofy coat and dances to “Psycho Killer.” Responding to this needle-drop abuse of the Talking Heads, I wrote “'Psycho Killer'? REALLY?!” in my notepad. Ten seconds later, I wrote under that, “OK, I’m down.” Later,
                                the villain of the piece, Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce) makes a snarky comment about the film’s use of the song and how stupid it is. It’s as if the filmmakers anticipated my initial response but had no faith that I’d eventually
                                buy into their idea and go along.
                                <br> The person responsible for the musical choice in the film’s universe is Eric (Siddharth Dhananjay), the techie who runs Harting’s simulator. See, Garrison is actually a re-animated dead soldier who’s been implanted
                                with false memories of his wife’s murder so that he can take brutal revenge on Harting’s enemies. The simulator implants the same exact remembrances in Garrison’s head but changes the identity of the dancing killer. The
                                simulator keeps the song, however, which makes the dialogue calling attention to it even more obnoxious. In a stunning self-own of “Bloodshot”’s writers, Eric supposedly crafted Garrison’s quest from the pieces of other
                                action movies. Harting points out that he did a lousy job right down to the penis jokes. Nevertheless, it’s an effective facsimile because Garrison does the execution every time his brain is rebooted.

                                In longstanding ongoing serial storytelling franchises, eventually the inclination to make a fresh start with iconic characters will arise. It happens with some regularity in Marvel and DC superhero comics, to varying degrees of commercial and critical
                                success. In their corresponding movies (and television), multiple iterations of Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, the Joker, the Flash, and others have appeared over the last twenty years. Both Marvel and DC rely on the concept
                                of a multiverse, sometimes telling stories with different versions of a character simultaneously. The Star Wars franchise, by contrast, has (to date) rejected this approach. From the early 1990s until the early 2010s, Lucasfilm
                                maintained a single continuity. Although the execution was imperfect within the Expanded Universe storyline, not to mention attempting to reconcile those tales with George Lucas’ concurrent storytelling in the Prequel Trilogy
                                and The Clone Wars, the basic premise held firm: Star Wars did not have alternate timelines, nor would it reboot its characters each time it brought aboard new creative teams. After the acquisition by Disney and the decision
                                to make new Star Wars movies on an ongoing basis, Lucasfilm rebooted – but maintained the principle of a single continuity for the franchise. The prior storyline, rebranded as Legends, would close down; the new storyline,
                                begun with The Force Awakens and its tie-in materials, would launch a new continuity in which future Star Wars storytelling across all mediums would (imperfectly) be kept consistent and integrated as a single timeline.
                                Star Wars was not, and (to date) is not, a multiverse.
                                <br> The year 2012 provides an interesting point of comparison for examining two different opportunities for fresh starts with prominent female characters. Though the stories ultimately released a few years later, the reboot
                                of Star Wars originates in 2012: George Lucas’ work on a treatment for the Sequel Trilogy, the arrival of Kathleen Kennedy, the formation of a story group and a creative brain trust, the announcement of the Disney purchase
                                of Lucasfilm, and the formal completion of the acquisition just before the end of the year. With far less global fanfare at the time, in 2012 Marvel Comics also rebooted the character of Carol Danvers, making her the titular
                                character in a Captain Marvel comic written by Kelly Sue DeConnick. Seven years later, a Captain Marvel film inspired by DeConnick’s characterization made over a billion dollars at the global box office, and Episode IX:
                                The Rise of Skywalker will arrive in theaters in December.<br> The fresh start for the character of Captain Marvel demonstrates how ongoing serial storytelling can take advantage of such a reboot to strengthen the character
                                and the franchise. Within the realm of comics storytelling, DeConnick’s run on Captain Marvel marked another iteration of a character with over forty years of previous appearances, but the fresh start she unveiled for Carol
                                Danvers made a far greater impact than simply a new take on a familiar face. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Captain Marvel film introduced that newly redefined character to a broad global audience without preconceived
                                notions of backstory or characterization. Taken together, these stories completely changed the trajectory of the character.<br> First, the new Captain Marvel – for the first time written by women – is guided by a consistent
                                vision of who the character is, rather than ad hoc development over time. When written by varying creative teams of men, Carol Danvers was Ms. Marvel, Binary, and Warbird; a member of the Avengers, or the X-Men, or not
                                part of a team; an Earth-bound human or a cosmic alien hybrid. DeConnick’s Captain Marvel, Margaret Stohl’s The Life of Captain Marvel, and the Captain Marvel film each presents a different variation on the specific origin
                                of her powers – but the characterization, personality traits, and motivations remain constant and reliably written.<br> Second, the new Captain Marvel repudiates and repairs many of the problematic tropes that had mired
                                the character in the decades she was written by men. As thoroughly laid out in the her chapter in Carolyn Cocca’s book Superwomen: Gender, Power, and Representation, Carol Danvers has over the years been written with tropes
                                including: a love interest to a much more powerful man; fainting from overexertion when taxing her powers, or having a split personality between her ordinary and superpowered lives; impregnation by rape; experimentation
                                by evil aliens; depowering for an extended period of time, or memory loss for an extended time, both later repaired by a powerful male character; often the sole female character, or having few or no female friends; portrayal
                                as humorless and shrill; and of course, drawn in sexualized costumes or poses. Some of the men who wrote or drew her over the years meant well, but ultimately could not escape what Cocca describes as “good intentions and
                                blind privilege” (page 188). In DeConnick’s hands, these tropes are eliminated or retconned. In the movie, Carol has agency throughout the story, including investigating her amnesia and firing the shot that results in her
                                acquiring superpowers, as well as the support of friends and allies. The new Captain Marvel is the central character in her own story, rather than an adjunct to the adventures of men.

                                Dora the Explorer was after my time, a cartoon for young children that came around long after my Saturday morning cartoon days were over. And yet, despite being one completely uninitiated and cynical thirtysomething, I found Dora and the Lost City of
                                Gold to be a charming delight. Aged up from the show, Dora’s now a teenager who has spent many of her formative years in the jungle with a pair of well-meaning archeologist parents (Michael Peña, Eva Longoria). Thrust into
                                high school in Los Angeles, she’s an odd duck and beacon of positivity amid the cynical squalor of American modernity. Suck out all pretension and she’s simply the smartest, kindest person in the room.
                                <br> Isabella Moner is a bright-eyed, exuberant presence as Dora, always ready to sing or swing into a grand adventure<br> She has a big heart and an even bigger reservoir of tools and tricks to help her navigate the jungle
                                and jungle puzzles that pose any danger to her and her friends. It’s refreshing how director James Bobin and writers refrain from turning her into Moron Exhibit A when surrounded by the relatively unknown perils of high
                                school or adolescent social norms. Dora’s new to it but she’s no dummy. She’s full of spunk and surprise, but without the overdone naivete that often accompanies fish-out-of-water hijinks. What sets Lost City apart from
                                other TV cartoon adaptations is a cute loyalty to the tone and wild abandon of its forebear, including characters who don’t immediately translate to live action. There’s a running, robbing, talking fox named Swiper who
                                looks like he stepped out of a Fantastic Mr. Fox spin-off, and he’s voiced by Benicio Del Toro of all people. There’s even an extended sequence wherein psychedelic flowers plunge Dora and friends into a fully 2D animated
                                state. Add in anthropomorphic monkey Boots and villainous performances pitched waaay over the top, and you’d be forgiven for forgetting this was a movie-movie from time to time.
                                <br> Ultimately, this is a film aimed squarely at kids and tweens, and as such it often feels like a throwback to a time when kiddie flicks weren’t all computer animation. Once upon a time, a sense of true adventure permeated
                                these movies, and at some point between internet and smartphones the real-kids-on-a-quest genre went away. Dora is very much about a ragtag group of kids on a quest, finding treasure and themselves, and it’s all the better
                                for it. Stay for a foot-tapping musical sequence during the end credits.

                                Jacqueline Fernandez and Sushant Singh Rajput have been paired together for ‘Drive’ which is directed by Tarun Mansukhani and produced by Dharma Productions. However, the movie which was slated to have a theatrical release will now feature on Netflix
                                instead. The announcement about ‘Drive’ having a digital release was made by Karan Johar on his social media.<br> While the makers and producers have opted for a digital release, it wasn’t
                                something which was planned earlier. The movie’s theatre release was postponed as Karan Johar was reportedly unhappy with the way it turned out to be! According to a recent report, a source close to the film said, “Karan
                                has already sent the film back to director Tarun Mansukhani for re-shooting, twice. But he’s still not happy with the output. At the moment, the future of the film is uncertain. Karan is not willing to release it the way
                                it has shaped up.”
                                <br> However, as per a report in Mumbai Mirror, reports of digital release were denied initially. A source close to the project said, “The final edit has been locked, and presently the film is in the final stage of postproduction.
                                Contrary to reports that it is being reshot or will be premiered on the digital platform, Drive is on course to a regular theatrical release in the second half of the year.”
                                <br> In an exclusive interview with ETimes, Jacqueline Fernandez also revealed that due to VFX. Jacqueline said, “Unfortunately the VFX is taking a lot longer than Tarun had expected but the film is looking really cool.
                                Sushant is in it and he is brilliant as usual. And it is fun, it’s a very sexy film - car, action! You will actually see me doing a lot of action scenes in the movie. It is a film that I’m dying for it to release. I wanted
                                it to come sooner than it is. But, Tarun being the professional that he’s wants the VFX to look perfect. So, we are waiting...”
                                <br> While Jacqueline Fernandez was eagerly waiting for the movie to release in theatres, unfortunately it is up for a digital release instead. There were reports of creative differences between Karan Johar and Tarun Mansukhani
                                because of ‘Drive’. Reportedly, the movie’s VFX cost the team a lot however the rushes of the movie didn’t turn out well. Hence, initially KJo chose to delay the release of the movie as he wasn’t happy with the final output,
                                and looks like the filmmaker is no more in a mood to release it in theatres.

                                <br> Now that Karan Johar has struck a deal to make original content for the OTT platform it became easier for him to have a digital release for ‘Drive’. There is buzz that he spoke to both Sushant and Jacqueline about
                                his plans to release the film digitally much in advance before the official announcement today. All those who were eager to watch some high octane car scenes on the big screen are in for a huge disappointment given the
                                fact that this ‘Drive’ has had an early pit stop than expected!
